üç≥ Cooker Scratch Detection using Deep Learning
This project implements a **Deep Learning model** using **Keras/TensorFlow** to detect and classify **surface defects (Scratches)** on metal cooker surfaces. The aim is to automate defect detection in manufacturing and quality assurance.  

## Features  
- End-to-end training pipeline in Jupyter Notebook.  
- Preprocessing and augmentation of image dataset.  
- CNN-based defect classification model.  
- Model saved in `.h5` format for deployment.  
- Prediction output includes **class label + confidence score**.  

## Dataset  
The dataset used is the **NEU Metal Surface Defects Dataset**, consisting of images categorized into various defect types such as:  
- Scratch  
- Inclusion  
- Patches
- Pitted  
- Rolled-in Scale  
- etc.  

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack  
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## Project Workflow  
1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Load and split dataset into train/test.  
   - Apply normalization and augmentation.  

2. **Model Building**  
   - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
   - Trained with categorical crossentropy & Adam optimizer.  

3. **Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy and loss plots.  
   - Confusion Matrix & Classification Report.  

4. **Prediction**  
   - Example:  
     ```
     Prediction: Scratch (Confidence:0.9997)
     ```  

## Results

- Test Accuracy: **0.99**
- Precision (No Scratch): **0.99**
- Recall (No Scratch): **1.00**
- F1-score (No Scratch): **0.99**
- Precision (Scratch): **1.00**
- Recall (Scratch): **0.93**
- F1-score (Scratch): **0.96**

### Confusion Matrix (Summary)
|               | Predicted No Scratch | Predicted Scratch |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Actual No Scratch** | 144 | 0 |
| **Actual Scratch**    | 2   | 27 |

### Overall
- **Macro Avg F1-score:** 0.98  
- **Weighted Avg F1-score:** 0.99
